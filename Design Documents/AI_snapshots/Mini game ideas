Input: give me some mini game ideas

Output:
Here are some fun, simple mini-game ideas you can build or play anywhere:

1. Color Catch

Colored balls fall from the top of the screen; the player moves a basket left/right to catch only the correct color that matches a target shown.

2. One-Tap Jumper

A character auto-runs. Tapping jumps over obstacles. Holding makes a longer jump. Score increases with distance.

3. Memory Match Rush

Classic card-matching but timed: each round, you have less time to match all pairs. Occasionally add a “fake” pair to confuse players.

4. Shape Shifter

The player’s character changes shape (circle/square/triangle) every few seconds. Obstacles appear with shape-shaped holes; you can pass only if you match.

5. Swipe Duel

Two players (local) swipe in directions quickly when prompts appear (↑ ↓ ← →). Wrong swipe loses a point. First to 5 wins.

6. Tower Stack

Blocks swing left and right; tap to drop them. If they overhang too much, the extra gets cut off, making the next block smaller.

7. Ghost Maze

Tiny maze that changes every 10 seconds. A ghost chases the player but can only move when the player moves (turn-based feel).

8. Reaction Dot

A dot changes color randomly—tap only when it becomes green. Speed gradually increases.

9. Quick Draw Quiz

Small trivia questions with only 2–3 seconds to answer. Correct answers build a streak multiplier.

10. Gravity Flip

Player taps to flip gravity (up/down) to avoid obstacles. Simple lane-runner feel.

11. Mini Farm Loop

Tiny farm with a single plot: plant → grow → harvest → sell → upgrade to grow faster. Loop is short and satisfying.

12. Laser Deflect

Lasers move across the screen; the player rotates mirrors to redirect them into targets before the laser passes.
