\# Design Changes Log – Semester 1



This document records key design adjustments made after presenting the initial game prototype to the client and receiving feedback during Semester 1.



\## Initial Client Feedback Summary

\- The initial game concept and UI design were received positively by the client.

\- The client noted that the design was suitable but could be adjusted to better match the intended age range.

\- Suggestions were made to add more engaging features while keeping the core gameplay accessible and clear.



\## Key Changes and Design Responses



\- Adjusted the overall design focus to better suit the target age range by simplifying interactions and reducing unnecessary complexity.

\- Refined the core gameplay loop to ensure it is easy to understand while remaining engaging for repeated play.

\- Considered additional gameplay features that enhance engagement without overwhelming the player.

\- Reworked UI elements to improve clarity and readability for the intended audience.

\- Prioritised features that could realistically be implemented within the project scope and development timeline.

\- Deferred more complex mechanics to later stages of development (Semester 2) to maintain stability and feasibility.

\- Ensured that visual style and feedback systems support quick understanding of game objectives.

\- Incorporated client feedback into the consolidated group design after reviewing all individual prototypes.



\## Outcome

These changes informed the transition from individual prototypes to a unified group design. The updated direction was later captured in the Semester 1 design proposal and client sign-off documentation, providing a clear foundation for development in Semester 2.
