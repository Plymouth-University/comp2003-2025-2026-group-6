# Playtest Notes – Semester 1
Project: COMP2003 (Group 6)  
Author: Aarju Shrestha  
Phase: Early Prototype / Concept Validation  

## Purpose
These playtest notes document observations and findings from early testing of the game concept and prototype during Semester 1. The goal of this testing was to evaluate clarity, engagement, and feasibility before moving into more advanced development.

## Testing Context
- Testing was conducted informally using early prototypes and design walkthroughs.
- Feedback was gathered through observation, group discussion, and client comments.
- Focus was placed on gameplay clarity, complexity, and suitability for the intended age range.

## Key Observations

### 1. Gameplay Complexity
- Initial versions of the gameplay loop included multiple mechanics introduced too quickly.
- Testers required additional explanation to understand objectives and rules.
- This indicated a risk of overwhelming the intended audience.

### 2. Clarity of Objectives
- Players responded better when objectives were clearly visible and consistently reinforced.
- Ambiguity around scoring and win conditions reduced engagement during early testing.

### 3. User Interface and Readability
- UI elements were generally well received visually.
- Some elements required improved hierarchy and spacing to make key information easier to read.
- Clear distinction between teams improved player understanding.

### 4. Engagement and Replayability
- Competitive elements such as team scoring and leaderboards increased engagement.
- Shorter, more focused gameplay loops felt more replayable than longer, complex sessions.

## Design Changes Made After Testing
Based on the observations above, the following changes were prioritised:
- Simplified the core gameplay loop to focus on a single clear objective.
- Reduced the number of mechanics introduced at once.
- Improved UI clarity and visual hierarchy.
- Adjusted design decisions to better suit the target age range.
- Deferred more complex features to later stages of development (Semester 2).

## Outcome
These playtest findings informed the refined design direction documented in the Semester 1 design proposal and supported the transition from individual prototypes to a consolidated group concept. The results provided a clearer, more feasible foundation for development moving forward.
